/**
 * Phase 6C -- the mobile design system. Phase 6A/6B's flat `colors`
 * export is replaced by a light/dark PAIR behind a React context, since
 * a plain module-level constant can never react to a theme change at
 * runtime. Typography/spacing/radius/shadows/layout are scheme-
 * independent and stay as plain exports -- only color needs to be
 * reactive.
 *
 * Palette intent (explicit, since "scholarly/spiritual, not SaaS" is a
 * design requirement, not just a color choice): warm, muted, low-
 * saturation tones in both modes -- no pure black/white, no saturated
 * brand blues/purples, no gradients. Dark mode is a genuine second
 * palette (warm near-black, not an inverted/auto-generated one), tuned
 * for the same restrained character as light mode.
 *
 * Deliberately kept JSX-free (the actual <ThemeContext.Provider> lives in
 * ThemeProvider.tsx): Node's native TypeScript execution (`node --test`,
 * used by every test file in this project) strips types but does not
 * transform JSX, so a JSX-bearing .ts/.tsx file can only ever be
 * exercised via `expo export`, not `node --test`. Keeping this module
 * pure lets mobile/tests/ux.test.ts import resolveTheme() and the design
 * tokens directly.
