# /content-lib

The typed content boundary, per the non-negotiable content/code separation
rule:

```
/content  →  /content-lib (schemas + loader)  →  /app  →  /components
```

`/app` and `/components` will only ever receive typed content objects
produced by this layer — never read `/content` directly, and never
contain hardcoded recovered content.

```

## Schemas (Phase 5C)

Every content type — Divya Desam, Book, Chapter, Knowledge — has a Zod
schema that is the single source of truth for both runtime validation and
the inferred TypeScript type (`z.infer<typeof Schema>`). Key structural
guarantees, enforced by the schemas themselves:

- `status` defaults to `"draft"` everywhere. No schema defaults to
  `"published"`. Extraction confidence (`migration.extractionConfidence`)
  never influences `status`.
- Every optional field is genuinely optional — the schemas tolerate the
  legitimate variation already found in the source (e.g. a Divya Desam
  missing `sthalaPuranam`, zero images, zero shrines).
- Image `alt` text is never fabricated (`alt: string | null`); `altStatus`
  defaults to `"needs-review"`.
- The same image asset may legitimately appear on more than one content
  record — nothing in the schema layer enforces one-record-per-asset.

## Loader (Phase 5D)

The loader reads **only** from `/content` (JSON files). It never reads
`content-extraction/`, `images/`, or any historical SAP file — those are
migration source material, entirely outside this module's boundary. A
later, separate migration phase is what will eventually populate
`/content` from `content-extraction/`; the loader has no knowledge of that
process.

### Public API

```ts
loadDivyaDesams(): DivyaDesam[]
loadDivyaDesam(slug: string): DivyaDesam | null

loadBooks(): Book[]
loadBook(slug: string): Book | null

loadChapters(bookSlug: string): Chapter[]
loadChapter(bookSlug: string, chapterSlug: string): Chapter | null

loadKnowledge(): Knowledge[]
loadKnowledgeRecord(slug: string): Knowledge | null
```

Import from `content-lib/loader` (or, inside `/app`, via the `@/...`
alias — `@/content-lib/loader`). All of the above are pre-bound to the
real `/content` directory. `createContentLoader(contentRoot)` is also
exported for creating an independently-rooted loader instance (used by
tests to point at an isolated temporary directory — see
`tests/content/README.md`).

### Not-found convention

Every **single-record** lookup returns `null` when nothing matches —
never `undefined`, never a thrown error. Every **collection** loader
returns `[]` for an empty or nonexistent content directory. An empty
`/content` (its current, real state) is not an error condition anywhere
in this API.

Thrown errors (`content-lib/loader/errors.ts`) are reserved for actual
content problems: malformed JSON, a file that fails its Zod schema, a
duplicate slug within a collection, or duplicate chapter `order` within
one book. These always identify the offending file path.

### Ordering

- `loadDivyaDesams()` / `loadBooks()` / `loadKnowledge()` are sorted by
  `slug`, for deterministic output independent of filesystem enumeration
  order.
- `loadChapters(bookSlug)` is sorted by `chapter.order` ascending —
  **never** by filename or slug. Duplicate `order` values within one book
  throw rather than silently picking a winner.

### Book/chapter directory structure

```
content/library/<directory-name>/book.json
content/library/<directory-name>/chapters/*.json
```

The directory name is organizational only. The book's identity for every
lookup is its **validated** `slug` field inside `book.json` — the loader
never infers or rewrites a slug from a directory name, and a directory
name is never required to match its book's slug (this is deliberate: it's
what allows two different book directories to be correctly detected as a
*duplicate slug* error, rather than being silently prevented from
existing in the first place — see the doc comment at the top of
`content-lib/loader/index.ts` for the full reasoning).

### Path safety

Slug-based lookups never build a filesystem path from caller-supplied
input. Every lookup loads the already-discovered, already-validated
collection and matches the requested slug in memory against each
record's own validated `slug`. A malformed or malicious slug (e.g.
`"../../etc/passwd"`) is also rejected immediately by the slug-format
check before any filesystem access — but even without that check, there
is no code path where such a value could reach `fs.readFileSync`.

### Server-side boundary

The loader uses `node:fs`/`node:path` directly and must never be imported
into a Client Component. No extra package was installed to enforce this —
Next.js's own bundler already refuses to bundle `node:fs` for the client,
so an accidental client-side import fails the build on its own.

## What's still not here

- **Migration** (turning `content-extraction/` into real `/content`
  files) is a separate, later phase. `/content` currently contains no
  real records — 0 Divya Desams, 0 Books, 0 Chapters, 0 Knowledge items —
  and this loader phase does not change that.
- No MDX/Markdown/YAML/frontmatter support — `/content` is JSON-only for
  now (Phase 5D scope). A richer format for long-form bodies, if ever
  adopted, is a distinct, explicitly-approved future decision.
- No caching layer beyond what's naturally implied by reading small JSON
  files synchronously — content volume doesn't currently justify one.
