/**
 * Phase 5N -- sitemap built from the real content loader, not a
 * separately maintained list. Includes only genuinely publicly routable
 * pages:
 *   - the fixed set of static application routes
 *   - all 107 normal Divya Desam records
 *   - the 1 Book + all of its 55 Chapters (via loadChapters, so the
 *     count always matches whatever the loader actually returns)
 *   - the 1 Knowledge record
 *
 * Deliberately excluded, structurally rather than by a denylist:
 *   - Page150 (the held-back record) -- it has no slug and is never
 *     returned by loadDivyaDesams(), so there is no code path that
 *     could include it
 *   - Page112/Page115/Page116 (known source gaps) and the nonexistent
 *     Page117 -- none of these were ever migrated into a real record,
 *     so none can appear here either
 *   - arbitrary /search?q=... URLs -- only the bare /search route is
 *     listed, matching its own noindex-on-query metadata policy
 *
 * No production origin has been established for this project (see
 * lib/site.ts) -- entries are absolute URLs when NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL is
 * configured, and root-relative paths otherwise. A sitemap with
 * root-relative <loc> values does not strictly conform to the
 * sitemaps.org protocol (which expects absolute URLs), but this is the
 * only choice that doesn't fabricate a production domain; it becomes
 * fully conformant automatically once a real origin is configured, with
 * no further code changes.
 *
 * Uses RELATIVE imports (not the "@/" alias) so this module can be
 * imported directly by `node --test` -- the same reason
 * content-lib/search/*.ts does the same. app/sitemap.ts (the actual
 * Next.js convention file) is a thin wrapper around this.
